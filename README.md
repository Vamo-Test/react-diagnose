# react-diagnose

Instantly analyze and optimize React components with advanced diagnostics.

A self-contained interactive micro-product — one HTML document (markup, styles, and
JavaScript inline), served by a zero-dependency Cloudflare Worker. No framework, no
build step, no external requests: it works offline and loads instantly.
